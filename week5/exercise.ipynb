Dupéré n’a pas consulté les bons fichiers.  Comme il le sera démontré dans cette section, plusieurs milliers de lignes de code de programmations ont été réalisées par MICROCOM et livré au client.  De plus, plusieurs travaux effectués par MICROCOM, ils étaient accomplis dans la base de données du logiciel Odoo et non dans les fichiers de code source, d’autre part, une bonne quantité d’heures de travails consistait à de l’analyse, de la discussion sur les besoins, de la gestion de projet, de la formation par exemple. (Annexe A)\\n\\n\\n\\nInstallation Odoo :\\n\\n\\n\\nDans le cas de l’installation Odoo de Airpura, MICROCOM indique avoir utilisé le système Docker qui permet d’encapsuler le système d’exploitation ainsi que l’installation Odoo. Cela permet entre-autre d’avoir plusieurs environnements sur une même machine virtuelle Linux et de simplifier l\\'installation. \\n\\n\\n\\nLes fichier /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/openerp, /user/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/openerp/addons ainsi que le fichier /etc/odoo/openerp-server.conf ne sont pas utiliser lors de nos installations. Ces fichiers sont encapsulés dans le docker et ne sont pas directement accessibles sur la VM elle-même. Pour pouvoir faire des comparaisons de ces fichiers, il faut connaître le fonctionnement de docker. \\n\\n\\n\\nDe plus, il faut noter que les fichiers dont les dates de changements ont été auditées dans les fichiers journaux correspondent au code source de l’application Odoo.  La méthode de travail usuelle de la plateforme Odoo est de ne pas faire de modification directement dans ces fichiers mais de créer de nouveaux modules dans des fichiers séparés et dans un dossier séparé qui se charge en mémoire après les fichiers source de l’application Odoo pour remplacer, modifier ou ajouter des fonctions au logiciel. Les modules spécifiques aux clients sont classés dans les dossiers “/opt/odoo/additional_addons” accessible dans le docker, ils sont cependant également disponibles sur la machine virtuelle dans “/odoo/air/additional_addons” les 2 répertoires sont liés ensemble.\\n\\n\\n\\nIl est aussi possible que M. Dupéré ne connaisse pas Docker et n\\'ait pas pu identifier sa présence sur le serveur de Airpura et qu’il ait fait son analyse sur l’ancienne machine virtuelle de la version 9 de Odoo. Cette machine a été complètement abandonnée fin 2016 puisque nous en avons créé une nouvelle avec la version 10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContrôle, écriture et modification du code\\n\\n\\n\\nAfin de contrôler le code source, MICROCOM utilise GitHub qui permet de conserver l’historique complet des changements au code source.\\n\\n\\n\\nMICROCOM détient un répertoire différent dans l’optique d’identifier les changements pour chacun de ses clients.\\n\\n\\n\\nDans Git, on appelle “commits” chaque livraison d’une session de travail (qui peuvent contenir des ajouts, modifications, ou suppression de code) par un développeur dans un projet.\\n\\n\\n\\nPour les 14 modules développés spécifiquement pour Airpura il y a eu 299 commits  pour 5410 lignes de code écrites. De plus, pour le développement effectué au module communautaire Pledra il y a eu 71 commits pour 6164 lignes de codes ajoutées, modifiées ou supprimées.\\n\\n\\n\\nVoici quelques exemples des commits au fil du temps :\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIl est possible de comparer les changements effectués dans chacun de ses commits. Dans certains cas il peut n’y avoir que quelques changements et dans d\\'autres il peut y avoir des centaines de changements. Voici quelques exemples de comparaison de code.\\n\\nSe référer à l’Annexe B pour plus d’exemple et de détails.\\n\\nDans cet exemple du 6 novembre, il y a eu 44 lignes de codes ajouter et 21 détruites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDans celui-ci, daté du 20 octobre 2017 il y a eu 40 lignes de code ajoutées et 2 détruites.\\n\\n\\n\\nLa totalité de ces changements est aussi disponible sur la machine virtuelle Odoo 10 laquelle se trouvait jusqu’au moment où nos accès ont été coupés, sur le serveur physiquement présent aux bureaux de Airpura.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nL’opinion émise par M. Dupéré au fait que : “il est improbable voir impossible de reprendre le travail que MICROCOM a fait” est contradictoire et illogique, comment peut-il affirmer une telle chose et ce tout en indiquant l’absence soit disante de travail car aucun fichier n’aurait été modifié durant le mandat de MICROCOM. \\n\\n\\n\\nQuant à la suite “qu’il serait plus coûteux d’analyser le code source pour le récupérer que de recommencer\", il aurait fallu que M. Dupéré trouve le code que nous avons développé et l’analyse pour pouvoir affirmer une telle chose.  Ayant moi même vu plus de 11,500 lignes de codes développées par MICROCOM, il n’y a aucune  raison qui justifie qu’un autre développeur ne puisse pas utiliser, modifier ou bonifier ces travaux.\\n\\n\\n\\nIl apparaît clair que M. Dupéré ne connaît pas la plateforme Odoo car c’est la pratique la plus commune que de reprendre des modules fait par d’autres développeurs.\\n\\n\\n\\nVoici un lien vers un tutoriel Odoo qui explique le processus de création et modification de modules (le document est fait pour la version 13, mais le principe est similaire dans le version 10, utilisée dans le projet Airpura) :\\n\\nhttps://odooskills.com/developpement-de-votre-premiere-application-en-utilisant-le-framework-odoo-13.html\\n\\n(voir en Annexe C)\\n\\n\\n\\nVoir ce lien vers le “apps store” de l’éditeur Odoo qui contient 34,208 modules (en date du 21 janvier 2022) développés par des centaines de développeurs afin d’être utilisés tel quel ou modifés par d’autres développeurs : https://apps.odoo.com/apps \\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVoir ce lien vers le Github de l\\'OCA (Odoo community association) qui a but but de permettre à des développeurs de créer conjointement et simultanément des modules sur la plateforme Odoo.  il y a 184 repository qui corresponde à des sujets de développement tel que le module comptabilité, vente, achat, inventaire, etc … Chaque repository contient un grand nombre de modules  : https://github.com/OCA?page=1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMéthodologie du projet\\n\\n\\n\\nLa présente section fait référence à la section 3 de l’expertise menée par M. Dupéré  intitulée méthodologie du projet allant de la page 7 à 11 ainsi que le résumé “Principe entourant les projets d’implantation “ situé à la page 4. \\n\\n\\n\\nDans la proposition de service initiale de MICROCOM (AIR1701) l’entreprise ne s’engage pas à utiliser une méthodologie précise pour le projet, il propose une procédure d’implémentation, laquelle reprend des éléments de la méthode agile.  Dans ce type et cette taille de projet, ce type de fonctionnement me parait approprié.\\n\\n \\n\\nAgilité\\n\\n\\n\\nIl m\\'apparaît que M. Dupéré n’ait pas une haute opinion de l’agilité si on s’en fie à ce passage de la page 9 de son rapport : “À sa base, Agile n’est pas une méthodologie, mais une façon de faire. En bref, Agile fait la même chose que vous et moi si nous faisons face à trop à faire et pas assez de temps“.\\n\\n\\n\\nPourtant l’agilité est reconnue comme le cadre  privilégié et principalement utilisée dans ce genre de projet.\\n\\n\\n\\nL’Agilité est avant-tout un état d’esprit qui met en avant la collaboration entre les différents acteurs impliqués dans un projet. \\n\\nLe document de référence est le Manifeste Agile (écrit en 2001) qui décrit les 4 valeurs et les 12 principes fondateurs de l’Agilité. \\n\\nLes 4 valeurs sont\\xa0:\\n\\nLes individus et leurs interactions\\xa0plus\\xa0que les processus et les outils\\n\\nDes logiciels opérationnels\\xa0plus qu’une documentation exhaustive\\n\\nLa collaboration avec les clients\\xa0plus que la négociation contractuelle\\n\\nL’adaptation au changement\\xa0plus que le suivi d’un plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nIl s’agit en fait d’un cadre de fonctionnement, et non pas d’une méthode.\\n\\n\\n\\nL’objectif ultime, comme dans tout projet, est de livrer au client une solution qui soit opérationnelle et remplisse les besoins, le jour de la livraison.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn oppose souvent les deux approches «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0» et «\\xa0Agile\\xa0»\\xa0:\\n\\n\\n\\nL’approche «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0» est une approche qui a été créée en 1970, à une époque où les outils d’analyse et de développement n’avaient pas la performance actuelle.  Avec le temps, les technologies ont évolué et le rythme de changement s’est accéléré. Le cadre contractuel défini initialement s’est avéré un piège plus qu’une aide et les disputes entre client et fournisseurs ont été plus fréquentes\\xa0: avec le mode «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0» on délivre ce qui est écrit, même si le contexte a évolué ou le besoin n’a pas été bien compris. Le changement est régi par un avenant au contrat qui consiste à écrire la nouvelle demande ou la demande modifiée. Ceci servira de nouvelle référence écrite. Il est à noter que l’approche «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0» est toujours adaptée à certains projets qui sont d’une énorme complexité  par essence\\xa0: construction de fusée, de barrage hydro-électrique…\\n\\nL’approche «\\xa0Agile\\xa0» prend pour hypothèse que le Client peut (va) faire évoluer son besoin au cours du projet. La raison principale est qu’il va réellement comprendre ce qu’on lui délivre au moment où il verra le résultat, et même plutôt quand il va l’utiliser. C’est pourquoi l’approche «\\xa0Agile\\xa0» privilégie les démonstrations de prototypes au plus tôt dans le projet, réduit à l’essentiel la documentation et stimule la collaboration entre le client et le fournisseur, mais aussi entre les différents acteurs spécialistes chez le fournisseur. Utilisée d’abord sur des projets de quelques semaines, l’approche «\\xa0Agile\\xa0» est maintenant mise en œuvre sur des projets de grande ampleur.\\n\\nCependant, il reste une phase qui est commune aux deux approches\\xa0: l’analyse initiale parfois appelée Analyse fonctionnelle. C’est l’étape essentielle qui va initier la relation entre le client et le fournisseur et définir le cadre de travail.\\n\\n\\n\\nL’objectif est le même pour les deux approches\\xa0: \\n\\nComprendre le contexte du client\\n\\nComprendre le contexte du projet\\n\\nDéfinir les domaines fonctionnels et les fonctionnalités attendues\\n\\nÉtablir un plan de livraison (aussi appelé macro-planning) pour déterminer les échéances attendues avec le type de livrables (documentation logiciels, procédures…)\\n\\nS’accorder sur les principes de collaboration\\xa0: «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0», «\\xa0Agile\\xa0» ou autres\\n\\nDéfinir le budget\\xa0: soit nécessaire à la réalisation (demande du fournisseur), soit la capacité d’investissement du Client\\n\\nEt bien sûr la validation de ces éléments avant le l’exécution des livrables\\n\\n\\n\\nL’approche «\\xa0Agile\\xa0» étant basée sur un cadre, il appartient à chaque entreprise de préciser le mode opératoire d’application de ce cadre. Dans ce mode opératoire, il n’est pas nécessaire par exemple de lister dans une proposition de Services le détail de fonctionnement du projet. Certains vont privilégier la précision avec les détails de leur méthode, d’autres vont rester plus général et donner le contexte global.\\n\\n\\n\\nMICROCOM a choisi le second mode vu la nature et la taille du projet. Notamment, on ne peut parler d’approche «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0» implicite sans que soient précisées les étapes, livrables, plan et statuts d’avancement de manière explicite. En effet les principes fondateurs de l’approche «\\xa0Cascade\\xa0» reposent sur un jeu de documents explicites qui sont validés a priori pas les parties prenantes (pouvant aller même jusqu’à la signature pour marquer le consentement\\xa0: documents d’analyses, plan de livraison, cahier de recette…)\\n\\n\\n\\nDans le déroulement d’un projet en approche «\\xa0Agile\\xa0»\\xa0la clé de la réussite va reposer sur la collaboration active des parties prenantes. Cette collaboration se présente principalement sous forme de\\xa0rencontres (souvent régulières); il s’agit ici d’échanges, de retour du client sur ce qui est présenté ou démontré, de demandes de modification, d’éclaircissement. Tant que les demandes ne modifient pas les deux dimensions fixes du projet (voir note ci-dessus).\\n\\n\\n\\nL’un des moyens utilisés pour soutenir cette collaboration est le principe de prototype. Il s’agit d’une notion assez large qui couvre autant des maquettes que la solution logicielle elle-même. D’un point de vue pratique, les développements et démonstrations sont souvent effectués dans l’environnement du fournisseur pour limiter les interactions avec les systèmes opérationnels du Client. En effet l’approche «\\xa0Agile\\xa0» est basée sur des aller-retours voir des essais-erreurs, d’où l’importance d’un environnement indépendant.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\n\\nMa conclusion est sans équivoque, il a été amplement démontré que l’expertise de M. Dupéré manque totalement de fondement, est illogique et contradictoire, M. Dupéré ne semble avoir aucune connaissance de la plateforme Odoo. il est évident que MICROCOM a effectué une somme de travail considérable, les registre de Git le prouve hors de tout doute.  Rien dans plus de 11, 500 lignes de code fourni en annexe ne laisse croire à un manquement de la part de MICROCOM dans les standards de de qualité normalement reconnus dans l’industrie et la communauté Odoo.  Quant à la méthode de travail, elle me semble tout à fait approprié pour ce type de mandat.\\n\\n\\thttps://mail.google.com/mail/b/ALGkd0zjNn5JtzcfKJgrtiwWqC411Z3ZjPOgjEjxZhZwFKXzXat8/u/0/?ik=a8938f21d6&view=pt&search=all&permthid=threa…\\t/\\n\\n\\thttps://mail.google.com/mail/b/ALGkd0zjNn5JtzcfKJgrtiwWqC411Z3ZjPOgjEjxZhZwFKXzXat8/u/0/?ik=a8938f21d6&view=pt&search=all&permthid=threa…\\t/')]\n",

Intégration du logiciel Odoo\\n Odoo est un logiciel extrêmement modulaire qui couvre les besoins d’une entreprise quel que soit son domaine. Cela signifie que tous les modules ne doivent pas et ne seront pas utilisés au cours de la mission. Voici une liste qui reprend et décrit les modules sélectionnés car ils apparaissent indispensables à la réussite de la mission.\\n\\n\\n* CRM :  Odoo CRM vous aidera à gérer vos opportunités de manière structurée et facile. Vous pouvez avoir plusieurs équipes chacune avec son propre pipeline de vente. Un pipeline est constitué d'opportunités qui évoluent à travers des étapes configurables.\\n* Sales : Vous pouvez créer et envoyer des devis soignés en quelques clics. Vous pouvez également utiliser des modèles prédéfinis pour travailler plus efficacement. Vous pouvez envoyer vos devis par e-mail ou les imprimer directement depuis Odoo. Vous pouvez même demander à votre client de signer électroniquement et de payer en ligne avec nos devis en ligne, en collaboration avec un système de paiement intégré.\\n* Invoicing : Vous pouvez facilement créer des factures à partir de commandes clients qui ont été confirmées : automatiquement, par lot ou une par une.  Les ventes et la facturation sont intégrées en termes de politique de facturation (à la confirmation, à la livraison).\\n* Accounting : L’application accounting génère automatiquement toutes les écritures comptables à partir de vos factures fournisseurs, factures clients, amortissements d'actifs, produits différés, mouvements de stock, etc. Pas besoin d'entrées manuelles. Grâce à notre synchronisation en ligne, vos relevés bancaires peuvent être automatiquement synchronisés et importés dans Odoo. Il vous suffit de valider le rapprochement entre l'écriture comptable et les lignes du relevé, ce qui peut être fait en temps réel.\\n* Inventory & Purchase : Les applications d'inventaire et d'achat vous donnent un aperçu clair des mouvements de stock : entrées de produits, livraisons sortantes, transferts internes, dropshipping, et tous ces mouvements sont entièrement intégrés aux ventes, aux achats et à la fabrication. Les produits physiques sont contrôlés à partir d'ici et vous permettent de contrôler toutes les informations pertinentes relatives à vos articles, y compris le type (stockable ou consommable,..), s'ils sont vendables ou fabriqués, l'itinéraire de l'inventaire, la politique de facturation, les vendeurs privilégiés, les catégories, les numéros d'article ou de référence, etc.\\n* Manufacturing, PLM, Maintenance & Quality  : La fabrication d'Odoo portera vos opérations de production à un niveau d'efficacité supérieur : traçabilité complète, versionnement de la nomenclature, routage et gestion des bons de travail, contrôle de la qualité, communication en temps réel, planification de la production, analyse des coûts, etc.  Vous pouvez utiliser le panneau de contrôle du poste de travail sur une tablette pour donner des instructions détaillées avec des fiches de travail, effectuer des contrôles de qualité, scanner les produits, suivre le temps et même connecter vos processus de fabrication avec les appareils connectés grâce à la boîte IoT.\\n* Subscription : Facturez facilement vos clients sur une base récurrente (mensuelle, annuelle,...), soyez payé automatiquement et maximisez vos revenus. En tant que gestionnaire de compte, vous pouvez facilement suivre vos clients, leur abonnement récurrent et ne jamais manquer une opportunité de up selling or de cross-selling.\\n* Website & eCommerce : Le Website builder vous permet de construire le site web de vos rêves en quelques clics : Choisissez un thème, glissez-déposez les composants que vous désirez et publiez vos premières pages instantanément. Une fois le site créé, il vous sera possible  de publier facilement du nouveau contenu ainsi que mettre à jour le contenu existant. Tant le site que le CMS sont parfaitement mobile-friendly. Vous pouvez ensuite ajouter des fonctionnalités supplémentaires au fur et à mesure de votre développement : offres d'emploi, commerce électronique, tickets d'assistance, événements, blog de l'entreprise, formulaire de contact, chat en direct, newsletter, portail client, etc. Bien entendu, tout sera intégré avec le back-end Odoo.\\n* Events : Gérer l'inscription aux événements et la vente de billets en ligne. Choisissez si vous souhaitez publier un événement gratuit ou demander à vos participants d'acheter des billets via la page de l'événement. Choisissez le mode de paiement avec traitement des cartes de crédit en ligne ou facturation aux clients. Définissez des conditions spéciales telles que le prix des billets pour les inscriptions anticipées, les avantages pour les membres (en fonction de votre abonnement) ou les différents niveaux de billets. Tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour augmenter votre participation à l'événement et gérer vos listes d'invités à partir d'un seul endroit.\\n* Studio : Odoo studio est un outil extrêmement puissant qui vous permet de personnaliser facilement votre logiciel de différentes manières . Vous pouvez rapidement créer de nouveaux champs : champs de texte simples, cases à cocher, HTML intégré, date, nombres entiers, menus déroulants, etc. Vous pouvez également ajouter un champ existant à n'importe quel modèle et établir de nouvelles connexions. Les rapports PDF peuvent également être personnalisés en quelques clics. Vous pouvez même créer une toute nouvelle application sur le tableau de bord principal à partir de zéro en utilisant Studio, soit en vous basant sur les fonctionnalités des applications Odoo préexistantes, soit en créant un design entièrement original.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1.3.   Développement sur mesure\\n\\n\\nXXXXXXX\\n \\n2.   Plateforme d’hébergement\\n\\n\\n Sous la condition de l'acceptation du Client, la base de données Odoo sera hébergée de l’une des trois manières suivantes : Odoo.sh / Odoo Cloud Platform / On-premise\\n\\n\\n2.1 Odoo.sh\\n Odoo.sh est une option d'hébergement Platform as a Service (PaaS) disponible pour le cloud et prête à l'emploi. La plateforme est entièrement intégrée à Github et permet l'utilisation d'applications certifiées Odoo ainsi que de n'importe laquelle des 20 000 applications disponibles sur l'Odoo Apps Store ou tout autre module personnalisé.\\n\\n\\nOdoo.sh est livré avec un nombre illimité de branches de développement et avec un nombre configurable de branches de mise en scène. Chaque commit, pull request, merge ou fork est testé et déployé automatiquement et vous obtenez des logs détaillés et filtrés en temps réel, directement dans la plateforme.\\n\\n\\nLa plateforme vous permettra de passer moins de temps à gérer et plus de temps à créer.\\n\\n\\nLes serveurs Odoo.sh ont un minimum de 99,9% de temps de fonctionnement pour toute base de données hébergée sur la plateforme et nous conserverons 14 sauvegardes complètes pendant une période allant jusqu'à 3 mois, que vous pourrez télécharger vous-même à tout moment.\\nCe sont des  centres de données  certifiés Tier-III ou équivalent, avec une redondance N+1 pour l'alimentation, le réseau et le refroidissement.\\nChaque base de données clients est répliquée en temps réel sur un stockage additionnel situé dans le même centre de données, de sorte qu'un basculement peut avoir lieu rapidement en cas de défaillance matérielle, sans perte de données.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n✓ Reproduction de la base de données\\n2 serveurs, pour l'équilibrage de la charge et le basculement.\\n \\n✓ Serveurs de mise à niveau\\nPour tester de nouvelles fonctionnalités avec vos propres données.\\n \\n✓ Serveurs de sauvegarde\\nSauvegardes incrémentielles quotidiennes sur 2 serveurs différents.\\n \\n✓ Tests automatisés\\nChaque commit est déployé et testé instantanément.\\n \\n✓ Accès SSH\\nAccès Shell aux serveurs de développement, de mise en scène et de production.\\n \\n✓ DNS & routes\\nConfigurez des routes personnalisées et laissez-nous gérer le DNS.\\n \\n✓ Passerelles de courrier électronique\\nPasserelles de messagerie électronique illimitées, configurées automatiquement.\\n \\n✓ Surveillance 24/24\\nOdoo surveille et entretient tous vos serveurs pour vous.\\n \\n✓ Un hébergement de premier ordre\\nUne installation parfaitement optimisée, un excellent matériel.\\n \\n✓ Votre propre runbot\\nTestez chaque branche de fonctionnalité en un clic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n2.2 Odoo Cloud Platform\\n Odoo Cloud Platform (SaaS) est une plateforme d'hébergement gratuite soutenue et maintenue par Odoo, l'hébergement est inclus dans le prix de la licence.\\n \\nCette plateforme vous permet de :\\n\\n\\n ✓ d'accéder à votre solution anyware en ligne\\n\\n\\n✓ Gérez vous-même la base de données (via le portail odoo)\\n\\n\\n✓ Profitez des mises à jour mineures entre les versions majeures (ex. v14.1) contenant des améliorations mineures.\\n\\n\\n✓ Profitez des services d'Odoo : https://www.odoo.com/cloud-sla\\n\\n\\n✓ Les personnalisations peuvent être effectuées par le biais de l'application Odoo studio, mais de façon limitée.\\nLes applications tierces de la boutique Odoo et les développements personnalisés ne sont pas disponibles sur la plateforme SaaS.\\n\\n\\n2.3 On-Premise\\n Dans ce cas de figure, le Client choisit d’installer les serveurs stockant la database Odoo directement chez lui, les modalités concernant le choix du serveur, les coûts d’installation et les coûts de maintenance devront être détaillés au cas par cas en fonction des besoins du client. Hormis pour des cas où la sécurité est CRITIQUE ou pour des raisons législatives, nous conseillons toujours de favoriser une installation sur le cloud, que ce soit odoo.sh ou Odoo Cloud Platform. Ce sont des solutions sûres, qui limitent fortement les coûts et qui seront plus facilement maintenable.\\n\\n\\n2.4 Firebase\\n Dans le cas où la mission nécessite le développement d’applications externes à Odoo et où ces applications nécessitent aussi le stockage de leurs données, celles-ci seront stockées sur la plateforme Firebase qui est une solution propriétaire de Google, alliant rapidité, sécurité, disponibilité et un prix raisonnable. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.   Déroulement de la mission\\n Nous allons reprendre ci-dessous les différents profils et activités que nous conseillons pour collaborer à une mise en œuvre réussie. Une personne dédiée de votre coté (SPoC), un retour d'information fréquent (communication agile) et une mise en œuvre progressive pour rester concentré.\\n\\n\\n3.1 Single Point of Contact (SPoC)\\n Votre mise en œuvre sera prise en charge par un chef de projet dédié qui maîtrise les fonctionnalités d'Odoo. Nous attendons la même chose de votre part : désigner et maintenir une seule et unique personne de contact qui prendra en charge et assumera les responsabilités concernant le projet. Cette personne, le point de contact unique (SPoC) doit avoir l'autorité en termes de prise de décision.\\n \\n L'un des facteurs les plus importants pour déterminer l'efficacité de votre mise en œuvre est le niveau d'implication du SPoC (et de vos équipes) dans le projet de mise en œuvre.\\n \\n Le SPoC est responsable de la transmission des connaissances (coordonner l'intervention des utilisateurs clés si nécessaire) et de la cohérence de la mise en œuvre d'un point de vue commercial (prise de décision, gestion du changement, etc.)\\n \\n Le chef de projet assure une formation fonctionnelle au SPoC afin qu'il puisse transmettre ces connaissances à ses collaborateurs.\\nPour que cette approche soit réussie, il est nécessaire que le SPoC soit également impliqué dans sa propre montée en compétences par l'auto-apprentissage via la documentation Odoo, la plateforme d'e-apprentissage et le test des fonctionnalités.\\n\\n\\n3.2 Communication agile \\n Une mise en œuvre Quickstart suit une méthodologie agile. Par conséquent, un retour d'information fréquent et une communication efficace sont essentiels à la réussite du projet.\\n Son optimisation nous amènera donc à suivre ces principes :\\n\\n\\n  ● Partage de la documentation de gestion du projet : La meilleure façon de s'assurer que toutes les parties prenantes d'un projet ont le même niveau de connaissances est de fournir un accès direct au document de suivi du projet (un organisateur de projet).\\nCe document contiendra au moins une liste des tâches à effectuer dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre pour lesquelles le niveau de priorité et le gestionnaire sont clairement définis.\\nL'organisateur de projet est un outil de suivi de projet partagé qui permet à la fois de suivre en détail les tâches en cours et l'avancement global du projet.\\n\\n\\n  ● Signaler les informations essentielles : Afin de réduire le temps de documentation à l'essentiel, nous suivrons les bonnes pratiques suivantes :\\n○ Les comptes rendus de réunion seront limités aux décisions et aux validations ;\\n○ Les statuts des projets ne seront établis que lorsqu'une étape importante sera atteinte ;\\n○ Des sessions de formation sur la solution standard ou personnalisée seront organisées.\\n\\n\\n3.3 Portée du projet\\n Une définition claire des besoins initiaux est cruciale pour assurer le bon déroulement du projet. En effet, lorsque toutes les parties prenantes partagent la même vision, l'évolution des besoins et le processus décisionnel qui en résulte sont plus simples et plus clairs.\\n \\n La modularité d'Odoo permet une approche progressive, application par application. Privilégier une mise en œuvre en plusieurs phases cohérentes avec des mises en production régulières et une reprise évolutive d'Odoo par les utilisateurs finaux a démontré son efficacité au fil du temps.\\nCette approche permet également d'identifier les lacunes et d'appliquer des actions correctives dès le début de la mise en œuvre.\\n \\n Au cours de chaque phase, le chef de projet apportera la solution la plus efficace pour répondre aux besoins exprimés.  Ces solutions peuvent parfois entrer en conflit avec la vision de l'utilisateur final d'une solution idéale.\\nDans ce cas, le client et le consultant appliqueront la règle des 80-20 :\\nSe concentrer sur 80 % des besoins exprimés et retirer les 20 % restants des objectifs les plus défavorables en termes de rapport coût/bénéfice (ces proportions peuvent bien sûr évoluer dans le temps).\\n\\n\\n Par conséquent, il sera considéré comme acceptable d'intégrer une manipulation plus longue si un soulagement global est constaté. Des modifications des processus d'entreprise peuvent également être proposées pour poursuivre ce même objectif.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.4 Personnalisations et développement\\n Odoo offre un environnement idéal pour mettre en œuvre de légères personnalisations (Odoo Studio) ou des personnalisations plus importantes (développement personnalisé).          \\nNéanmoins, l'adoption de la solution standard sera préférée le plus souvent possible afin \\nd'optimiser les délais de livraison du projet et d'offrir à l'utilisateur une stabilité à long \\nterme (aucune dette technique à migrer et à maintenir) et une évolutivité fluide de son \\nnouvel outil.\\n\\n\\n En effet, une quantité importante de développement sur mesure est en contradiction avec une mise en œuvre rapide et durable. C'est la raison pour laquelle il est recommandé de le faire :\\n\\n\\n  ● Ne développer que pour une bonne raison : La décision de développer doit toujours être prise lorsque le rapport coût-bénéfice est positif (gain de temps au quotidien, etc.). Par exemple, il sera préférable de réaliser un développement important afin de réduire le temps d'une opération quotidienne, plutôt qu'une opération à réaliser seulement une fois par trimestre. Il est généralement admis que plus la solution est proche de la norme, plus le processus de migration est léger et fluide, et plus les coûts de maintenance sont faibles pour les deux parties. De plus, l'expérience nous a montré que 60% des demandes de développement initiales sont abandonnées après quelques semaines d'utilisation d'Odoo standard.\\n\\n\\n  ● Remplacez, ne dupliquez pas : La décision de changer le logiciel de gestion a été prise pour une bonne raison. Dans ce contexte, le moment de la mise en œuvre est LE bon moment pour accepter et même être un initiateur de changement tant au niveau de la manière dont le logiciel sera utilisé qu'au niveau des processus de gestion de l'entreprise.\\n3.5 Différentes phases\\n XXXX\\n \\n4. Support, maintenance et upgrades\\n \\n Après le déploiement en production de votre nouvelle solution, vient de le temps de préparer la vie de cette dernière sur le long terme.  En effet, le milieu des nouvelles technologies évoluent extrêmement vite, que ce soit les systèmes d’exploitation de vos ordinateurs qui changent, les smartphones de vos employés qui sont remplacés par des neufs, des dysfonctionnements, des besoins ayant changés, … il y a de nombreuses raisons qui vont pousser le système mis en place à évoluer pour ne pas devenir obsolète. Il est dès lors primordial de mettre en place en système de maintenance efficace pour ne pas voir la durée de vie de la solution à quelques mois et pérenniser son investissement sur le long terme. Pour cela, nous allons décomposer les différentes facettes de maintenance et de support que nous proposons. \\n\\n\\n4.1 Support et migration des modules standard de Odoo\\n Toutes les applications standards de Odoo sont automatiquement couvertes par le contrat de licence négocié avec Odoo. Cette couverture comprend la résolution de bug ainsi que la migration chaque année vers la nouvelle version de Odoo.  Pour que le Client puisse garder un unique point de contact pour sa solution, istarii srl s’engage à relayer lui-même les bugs rapportés par le client à Odoo ainsi que les demandes de migrations et ce gratuitement. \\n Pour toutes interventions relatives à de la consultance, conseils, réponses aux questions, migration de donnée extérieurs vers odoo, soit le tarif horaire de 75€/h soit le tarif journalier 400€/jour sera appliqué en fonction de la durée de l’intervention.  À noter que ces tarifs sont susceptibles de pouvoir changer moyennant notification préalable du Client par istarii srl.\\n\\n\\n4.2 Maintenance du développement des modules sur-mesure de Odoo\\n Tout comme pour l’octroi des licences tel que discuté au point XX, la maintenance des modules créés spécifiquement dans le cadre de la mission passe par un contrat directement auprès de Odoo. Cet maintenance garantit que le développement personnalisé sera maintenu par le partenaire pour un montant mensuel récurrent, ce service comprend :\\n- Correction de bogues sur les codes personnalisés\\n- Migrations futures / mises à niveau\\n- Maintenance continue\\n- Utilisation sans souci de vos modules personnalisés\\n \\n La maintenance est calculée sur le nombre de lignes de codes des modules sur-mesure, le prix étant de 16 euros par mois pour 100 lignes de code  une fois que le développement est utilisé en production. Il est utile de préciser que l’outil se chargeant du calcul des lignes de code ne prend pas en compte les éventuels commentaires ou lignes vides mais bien uniquement les lignes de codes à proprement parlé.\\n\\n\\n4.3 Maintenance des applications externes à Odoo. \\n Si dans le cadre de la mission, de nouvelles applications ---mobiles, web, desktop … --- devaient être conçues, une maintenance externe au contrat avec Odoo doit également être établie. Il est à noter que istarii srl offre automatiquement une maintenance gratuite pour chaque application qu’elle produit pendant une période de 3 mois à partir de la mise en production de l’application. Cette maintenance a pour but de rassurer le Client et d’organiser une mise en déploiement aussi efficace et rapide que possible. En effet, tous les bugs détectés pendant cette période de transition devront être réglé par istarii srl sans frais pour le client.  Passé cette période, nous proposons une maintenance complète de l’application pour le prix de XX% du prix de developpement de l’application par an. \\nExemple: La maintenance d’une application qui a coûté 10.000 euros à développer, coûtera XX euros par an (XX%).\\n La maintenance couvre la résolutions de bugs, la mise à jour du système pour qu’il ne devienne pas obsolète, l’hébergement et la sauvegarde éventuelles des données du système ou du serveur assurant la communication entre différentes parties du système.\\n\\n\\n La maintenance ne couvre évidemment pas l’ajout de nouvelles fonctionnalités ou la modification de fonctionnalités déjà existantes si ce n’est pour corriger un problème fondamental par rapport à une de celles-ci.\\nIl est important de noter que cette maintenance n’est pas obligatoire, mais que toute intervention sera alors facturée au tarif en vigueur. Les périodes de maintenance sont de 1 an sauf stipulation contraires et istarii srl se réserve le droit d’adapter le prix de cette maintenance entre chaque période pour s’adapter aux conditions économique où à l’évolution technologique. Le cas échéant, istarii srl aura notifié le Client minimum 2 mois avant la fin de la période de maintenance. Dans le cas où le client ne souhaite pas payer une maintenance, il sera néanmoins tenu de payer les différents frais relatifs à l’hébergement si toutefois il y en a.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Prix\\n5.1 Mission\\n Voici un tableau récapitulatif des grandes phases du projet en termes de temps et de prix. \\nCe tableau est donné à titre indicatif et ne veut pas dire que le paiement doit être divisé en accordance avec ces phases, ni que le prix ne puisse pas évoluer compte tenu des circonstances rencontrées le long de la mission. \\n\\n\\n En effet, nous nous efforçons de faire une estimation précise du prix, maintenant, si le Client désire ajouter des fonctionnalités en cours de route il est évident que cela aura un impact sur le prix.\\n\\n\\n À l’inverse, si la mission se déroule sans encombre, avec une participation maximale du client, le nombre de jour requis pour mener à bien ladite mission s’en trouvera diminué. \\n\\n\\n Dans tous les cas, chaque déviation du plan tarifaire ci-dessous, dans un sens ou dans l’autre fera l’objet d’une discussion avec le Client pour trouver la solution la plus satisfaisante pour ce dernier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\tJour\\n\\tTarif journalier\\n\\tPrix\\n\\tImplémentation\\n\\t20\\n\\t1000\\n\\t20000\\n\\tMigration\\n\\t20\\n\\t1250\\n\\t25000\\n\\tGo-Live\\n\\t5\\n\\t1250\\n\\t6250\\n\\tTraining\\n\\t5\\n\\t1000\\n\\t5000\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t56250\\n\\t  \\n\\n\\n5.2 Maintenance des éléments externes à Odoo\\n\\n\\n \\n\\tPrix de dev.\\n\\tTaux maintenance\\n\\tPrix/année\\n\\tApplication Mobile\\n\\t20\\n\\t1000\\n\\t20000\\n\\tMigration\\n\\t20\\n\\t1250\\n\\t25000\\n\\tGo-Live\\n\\t5\\n\\t1250\\n\\t6250\\n\\tTraining\\n\\t5\\n\\t1000\\n\\t5000\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t56250\\n\\t \\n5.3 Calendrier de paiements \\nXXX\\n\\n\\n5.4 Licenses Odoo Enterprise \\n En plus du prix de la mission, le client signera un contrat avec Odoo SA relatif à l'octroi de licenses d’utilisation qui permettront au Client d’utiliser la solution en conditions réels. Dans un esprit agile et pour pouvoir s’occuper au plus vite de la migration des données de l’entreprise sur le logiciel Odoo, le contrat relatif aux licenses doit avoir été négocié dans la semaine qui suit le début de la phase d’implémentation.  La société istarii srl n’a aucun pouvoir décisionnaire sur le prix de ces licences. Un calculateur de prix est disponible publiquement à cette adresse: https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/pricing,  bien qu’il n’ait aucune valeur contractuelle.  Il est bon de rappeler que le prix total des licences sera fonction du nombre d’utilisateur, du nombre de modules utilisés ainsi que de la durée de la souscription aux licenses.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n6. Acceptation\\n\\n\\n En approuvant la mission décrite dans ce document, Le client certifie également avoir pris connaissance et accepté les conditions générales de ventes de la sociétés istarii srl, disponible sur demande ainsi que publiquement à l’adresse suivante https://www.istarii.com/conditions-generales-vente/. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFait à XX le XX en deux exemplaires, un pour le Client et un pour istarii srl.\\n\\n\\nNom et Signature du Client                                                Signature istarii srl\\n(à précéder de la mention “lu et approuvé”)\")]\n",

Vous pouvez même créer une toute nouvelle application sur le tableau de bord principal à partir de zéro en utilisant Studio, soit en vous basant sur les fonctionnalités des applications Odoo préexistantes, soit en créant un design entièrement original.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1.3.   Développement sur mesure\\n\\n\\nXXXXXXX\\n \\n2.   Plateforme d’hébergement\\n\\n\\n Sous la condition de l'acceptation du Client, la base de données Odoo sera hébergée de l’une des trois manières suivantes : Odoo.sh / Odoo Cloud Platform / On-premise\\n\\n\\n2.1 Odoo.sh\\n Odoo.sh est une option d'hébergement Platform as a Service (PaaS) disponible pour le cloud et prête à l'emploi. La plateforme est entièrement intégrée à Github et permet l'utilisation d'applications certifiées Odoo ainsi que de n'importe laquelle des 20 000 applications disponibles sur l'Odoo Apps Store ou tout autre module personnalisé.\\n\\n\\nOdoo.sh est livré avec un nombre illimité de branches de développement et avec un nombre configurable de branches de mise en scène. Chaque commit, pull request, merge ou fork est testé et déployé automatiquement et vous obtenez des logs détaillés et filtrés en temps réel, directement dans la plateforme.\\n\\n\\nLa plateforme vous permettra de passer moins de temps à gérer et plus de temps à créer.\\n\\n\\nLes serveurs Odoo.sh ont un minimum de 99,9% de temps de fonctionnement pour toute base de données hébergée sur la plateforme et nous conserverons 14 sauvegardes complètes pendant une période allant jusqu'à 3 mois, que vous pourrez télécharger vous-même à tout moment.\\nCe sont des  centres de données  certifiés Tier-III ou équivalent, avec une redondance N+1 pour l'alimentation, le réseau et le refroidissement.\\nChaque base de données clients est répliquée en temps réel sur un stockage additionnel situé dans le même centre de données, de sorte qu'un basculement peut avoir lieu rapidement en cas de défaillance matérielle, sans perte de données.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n✓ Reproduction de la base de données\\n2 serveurs, pour l'équilibrage de la charge et le basculement.\\n \\n✓ Serveurs de mise à niveau\\nPour tester de nouvelles fonctionnalités avec vos propres données.\\n \\n✓ Serveurs de sauvegarde\\nSauvegardes incrémentielles quotidiennes sur 2 serveurs différents.\\n \\n✓ Tests automatisés\\nChaque commit est déployé et testé instantanément.\\n \\n✓ Accès SSH\\nAccès Shell aux serveurs de développement, de mise en scène et de production.\\n \\n✓ DNS & routes\\nConfigurez des routes personnalisées et laissez-nous gérer le DNS.\\n \\n✓ Passerelles de courrier électronique\\nPasserelles de messagerie électronique illimitées, configurées automatiquement.\\n \\n✓ Surveillance 24/24\\nOdoo surveille et entretient tous vos serveurs pour vous.\\n \\n✓ Un hébergement de premier ordre\\nUne installation parfaitement optimisée, un excellent matériel.\\n \\n✓ Votre propre runbot\\nTestez chaque branche de fonctionnalité en un clic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n2.2 Odoo Cloud Platform\\n Odoo Cloud Platform (SaaS) est une plateforme d'hébergement gratuite soutenue et maintenue par Odoo, l'hébergement est inclus dans le prix de la licence.\\n \\nCette plateforme vous permet de :\\n\\n\\n ✓ d'accéder à votre solution anyware en ligne\\n\\n\\n✓ Gérez vous-même la base de données (via le portail odoo)\\n\\n\\n✓ Profitez des mises à jour mineures entre les versions majeures (ex. v14.1) contenant des améliorations mineures.\\n\\n\\n✓ Profitez des services d'Odoo : https://www.odoo.com/cloud-sla\\n\\n\\n✓ Les personnalisations peuvent être effectuées par le biais de l'application Odoo studio, mais de façon limitée.\\nLes applications tierces de la boutique Odoo et les développements personnalisés ne sont pas disponibles sur la plateforme SaaS.\\n\\n\\n2.3 On-Premise\\n Dans ce cas de figure, le Client choisit d’installer les serveurs stockant la database Odoo directement chez lui, les modalités concernant le choix du serveur, les coûts d’installation et les coûts de maintenance devront être détaillés au cas par cas en fonction des besoins du client. Hormis pour des cas où la sécurité est CRITIQUE ou pour des raisons législatives, nous conseillons toujours de favoriser une installation sur le cloud, que ce soit odoo.sh ou Odoo Cloud Platform. Ce sont des solutions sûres, qui limitent fortement les coûts et qui seront plus facilement maintenable.\\n\\n\\n2.4 Firebase\\n Dans le cas où la mission nécessite le développement d’applications externes à Odoo et où ces applications nécessitent aussi le stockage de leurs données, celles-ci seront stockées sur la plateforme Firebase qui est une solution propriétaire de Google, alliant rapidité, sécurité, disponibilité et un prix raisonnable. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3.   Déroulement de la mission\\n Nous allons reprendre ci-dessous les différents profils et activités que nous conseillons pour collaborer à une mise en œuvre réussie. Une personne dédiée de votre coté (SPoC), un retour d'information fréquent (communication agile) et une mise en œuvre progressive pour rester concentré.\\n\\n\\n3.1 Single Point of Contact (SPoC)\\n Votre mise en œuvre sera prise en charge par un chef de projet dédié qui maîtrise les fonctionnalités d'Odoo. Nous attendons la même chose de votre part : désigner et maintenir une seule et unique personne de contact qui prendra en charge et assumera les responsabilités concernant le projet. Cette personne, le point de contact unique (SPoC) doit avoir l'autorité en termes de prise de décision.\\n \\n L'un des facteurs les plus importants pour déterminer l'efficacité de votre mise en œuvre est le niveau d'implication du SPoC (et de vos équipes) dans le projet de mise en œuvre.\\n \\n Le SPoC est responsable de la transmission des connaissances (coordonner l'intervention des utilisateurs clés si nécessaire) et de la cohérence de la mise en œuvre d'un point de vue commercial (prise de décision, gestion du changement, etc.)\\n \\n Le chef de projet assure une formation fonctionnelle au SPoC afin qu'il puisse transmettre ces connaissances à ses collaborateurs.\\nPour que cette approche soit réussie, il est nécessaire que le SPoC soit également impliqué dans sa propre montée en compétences par l'auto-apprentissage via la documentation Odoo, la plateforme d'e-apprentissage et le test des fonctionnalités.\\n\\n\\n3.2 Communication agile \\n Une mise en œuvre Quickstart suit une méthodologie agile. Par conséquent, un retour d'information fréquent et une communication efficace sont essentiels à la réussite du projet.\\n Son optimisation nous amènera donc à suivre ces principes :\\n\\n\\n  ● Partage de la documentation de gestion du projet : La meilleure façon de s'assurer que toutes les parties prenantes d'un projet ont le même niveau de connaissances est de fournir un accès direct au document de suivi du projet (un organisateur de projet).\\nCe document contiendra au moins une liste des tâches à effectuer dans le cadre de la mise en œuvre pour lesquelles le niveau de priorité et le gestionnaire sont clairement définis.\\nL'organisateur de projet est un outil de suivi de projet partagé qui permet à la fois de suivre en détail les tâches en cours et l'avancement global du projet.\\n\\n\\n  ● Signaler les informations essentielles : Afin de réduire le temps de documentation à l'essentiel, nous suivrons les bonnes pratiques suivantes :\\n○ Les comptes rendus de réunion seront limités aux décisions et aux validations ;\\n○ Les statuts des projets ne seront établis que lorsqu'une étape importante sera atteinte ;\\n○ Des sessions de formation sur la solution standard ou personnalisée seront organisées.\\n\\n\\n3.3 Portée du projet\\n Une définition claire des besoins initiaux est cruciale pour assurer le bon déroulement du projet. En effet, lorsque toutes les parties prenantes partagent la même vision, l'évolution des besoins et le processus décisionnel qui en résulte sont plus simples et plus clairs.\\n \\n La modularité d'Odoo permet une approche progressive, application par application. Privilégier une mise en œuvre en plusieurs phases cohérentes avec des mises en production régulières et une reprise évolutive d'Odoo par les utilisateurs finaux a démontré son efficacité au fil du temps.\\nCette approche permet également d'identifier les lacunes et d'appliquer des actions correctives dès le début de la mise en œuvre.\\n \\n Au cours de chaque phase, le chef de projet apportera la solution la plus efficace pour répondre aux besoins exprimés.  Ces solutions peuvent parfois entrer en conflit avec la vision de l'utilisateur final d'une solution idéale.\\nDans ce cas, le client et le consultant appliqueront la règle des 80-20 :\\nSe concentrer sur 80 % des besoins exprimés et retirer les 20 % restants des objectifs les plus défavorables en termes de rapport coût/bénéfice (ces proportions peuvent bien sûr évoluer dans le temps).\\n\\n\\n Par conséquent, il sera considéré comme acceptable d'intégrer une manipulation plus longue si un soulagement global est constaté. Des modifications des processus d'entreprise peuvent également être proposées pour poursuivre ce même objectif.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n3.4 Personnalisations et développement\\n Odoo offre un environnement idéal pour mettre en œuvre de légères personnalisations (Odoo Studio) ou des personnalisations plus importantes (développement personnalisé).          \\nNéanmoins, l'adoption de la solution standard sera préférée le plus souvent possible afin \\nd'optimiser les délais de livraison du projet et d'offrir à l'utilisateur une stabilité à long \\nterme (aucune dette technique à migrer et à maintenir) et une évolutivité fluide de son \\nnouvel outil.\\n\\n\\n En effet, une quantité importante de développement sur mesure est en contradiction avec une mise en œuvre rapide et durable. C'est la raison pour laquelle il est recommandé de le faire :\\n\\n\\n  ● Ne développer que pour une bonne raison : La décision de développer doit toujours être prise lorsque le rapport coût-bénéfice est positif (gain de temps au quotidien, etc.). Par exemple, il sera préférable de réaliser un développement important afin de réduire le temps d'une opération quotidienne, plutôt qu'une opération à réaliser seulement une fois par trimestre. Il est généralement admis que plus la solution est proche de la norme, plus le processus de migration est léger et fluide, et plus les coûts de maintenance sont faibles pour les deux parties. De plus, l'expérience nous a montré que 60% des demandes de développement initiales sont abandonnées après quelques semaines d'utilisation d'Odoo standard.\\n\\n\\n  ● Remplacez, ne dupliquez pas : La décision de changer le logiciel de gestion a été prise pour une bonne raison. Dans ce contexte, le moment de la mise en œuvre est LE bon moment pour accepter et même être un initiateur de changement tant au niveau de la manière dont le logiciel sera utilisé qu'au niveau des processus de gestion de l'entreprise.\\n \\n \\n4. Support, maintenance et upgrades\\n \\n Après le déploiement en production de votre nouvelle solution, vient de le temps de préparer la vie de cette dernière sur le long terme.  En effet, le milieu des nouvelles technologies évoluent extrêmement vite, que ce soit les systèmes d’exploitation de vos ordinateurs qui changent, les smartphones de vos employés qui sont remplacés par des neufs, des dysfonctionnements, des besoins ayant changés, … il y a de nombreuses raisons qui vont pousser le système mis en place à évoluer pour ne pas devenir obsolète. Il est dès lors primordial de mettre en place en système de maintenance efficace pour ne pas voir la durée de vie de la solution à quelques mois et pérenniser son investissement sur le long terme. Pour cela, nous allons décomposer les différentes facettes de maintenance et de support que nous proposons. \\n\\n\\n4.1 Support et migration des modules standard de Odoo\\n Toutes les applications standards de Odoo sont automatiquement couvertes par le contrat de licence négocié avec Odoo. Cette couverture comprend la résolution de bug ainsi que la migration chaque année vers la nouvelle version de Odoo.  Pour que le Client puisse garder un unique point de contact pour sa solution, istarii srl s’engage à relayer lui-même les bugs rapportés par le client à Odoo ainsi que les demandes de migrations et ce gratuitement. \\n Pour toutes interventions relatives à de la consultance, conseils, réponses aux questions, migration de donnée extérieurs vers odoo, soit le tarif horaire de 75€/h soit le tarif journalier 400€/jour sera appliqué en fonction de la durée de l’intervention.  À noter que ces tarifs sont susceptibles de pouvoir changer moyennant notification préalable du Client par istarii srl.\\n\\n\\n4.2 Maintenance du développement des modules sur-mesure de Odoo\\n Tout comme pour l’octroi des licences tel que discuté au point XX, la maintenance des modules créés spécifiquement dans le cadre de la mission passe par un contrat directement auprès de Odoo. Cet maintenance garantit que le développement personnalisé sera maintenu par le partenaire pour un montant mensuel récurrent, ce service comprend :\\n- Correction de bogues sur les codes personnalisés\\n- Migrations futures / mises à niveau\\n- Maintenance continue\\n- Utilisation sans souci de vos modules personnalisés\\n \\n La maintenance est calculée sur le nombre de lignes de codes des modules sur-mesure, le prix étant de 16 euros par mois pour 100 lignes de code  une fois que le développement est utilisé en production. Il est utile de préciser que l’outil se chargeant du calcul des lignes de code ne prend pas en compte les éventuels commentaires ou lignes vides mais bien uniquement les lignes de codes à proprement parlé.\\n\\n\\n4.3 Maintenance des applications externes à Odoo. \\n Si dans le cadre de la mission, de nouvelles applications ---mobiles, web, desktop … --- devaient être conçues, une maintenance externe au contrat avec Odoo doit également être établie. Il est à noter que istarii srl offre automatiquement une maintenance gratuite pour chaque application qu’elle produit pendant une période de 3 mois à partir de la mise en production de l’application. Cette maintenance a pour but de rassurer le Client et d’organiser une mise en déploiement aussi efficace et rapide que possible. En effet, tous les bugs détectés pendant cette période de transition devront être réglé par istarii srl sans frais pour le client.  Passé cette période, nous proposons une maintenance complète de l’application pour le prix de XX% du prix de developpement de l’application par an. \\nExemple: La maintenance d’une application qui a coûté 10.000 euros à développer, coûtera XX euros par an (XX%).\\n La maintenance couvre la résolutions de bugs, la mise à jour du système pour qu’il ne devienne pas obsolète, l’hébergement et la sauvegarde éventuelles des données du système ou du serveur assurant la communication entre différentes parties du système.\\n\\n\\n La maintenance ne couvre évidemment pas l’ajout de nouvelles fonctionnalités ou la modification de fonctionnalités déjà existantes si ce n’est pour corriger un problème fondamental par rapport à une de celles-ci.\\nIl est important de noter que cette maintenance n’est pas obligatoire, mais que toute intervention sera alors facturée au tarif en vigueur. Les périodes de maintenance sont de 1 an sauf stipulation contraires et istarii srl se réserve le droit d’adapter le prix de cette maintenance entre chaque période pour s’adapter aux conditions économique où à l’évolution technologique. Le cas échéant, istarii srl aura notifié le Client minimum 2 mois avant la fin de la période de maintenance. Dans le cas où le client ne souhaite pas payer une maintenance, il sera néanmoins tenu de payer les différents frais relatifs à l’hébergement si toutefois il y en a.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Prix\\n5.1 Mission\\n Voici un tableau récapitulatif des grandes phases du projet en termes de temps et de prix. \\nCe tableau est donné à titre indicatif et ne veut pas dire que le paiement doit être divisé en accordance avec ces phases, ni que le prix ne puisse pas évoluer compte tenu des circonstances rencontrées le long de la mission. \\n\\n\\n En effet, nous nous efforçons de faire une estimation précise du prix, maintenant, si le Client désire ajouter des fonctionnalités en cours de route il est évident que cela aura un impact sur le prix.\\n\\n\\n À l’inverse, si la mission se déroule sans encombre, avec une participation maximale du client, le nombre de jour requis pour mener à bien ladite mission s’en trouvera diminué. \\n\\n\\n Dans tous les cas, chaque déviation du plan tarifaire ci-dessous, dans un sens ou dans l’autre fera l’objet d’une discussion avec le Client pour trouver la solution la plus satisfaisante pour ce dernier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\tJour\\n\\tTarif journalier\\n\\tPrix\\n\\tImplémentation\\n\\t20\\n\\t1000\\n\\t20000\\n\\tMigration\\n\\t20\\n\\t1250\\n\\t25000\\n\\tGo-Live\\n\\t5\\n\\t1250\\n\\t6250\\n\\tTraining\\n\\t5\\n\\t1000\\n\\t5000\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t56250\\n\\t \\n \\n5.2 Maintenance des éléments externes à Odoo\\n\\n\\n \\n\\tPrix de dev.\\n\\tTaux maintenance\\n\\tPrix/année\\n\\tApplication Mobile\\n\\t20\\n\\t1000\\n\\t20000\\n\\tMigration\\n\\t20\\n\\t1250\\n\\t25000\\n\\tGo-Live\\n\\t5\\n\\t1250\\n\\t6250\\n\\tTraining\\n\\t5\\n\\t1000\\n\\t5000\\n\\tTotal\\n\\t \\n\\t \\n\\t56250\\n\\t \\n5.3 Licenses Odoo Enterprise \\n En plus du prix de la mission, le client signera un contrat avec Odoo SA relatif à l'octroi de licenses d’utilisation qui permettront au Client d’utiliser la solution en conditions réels. Dans un esprit agile et pour pouvoir s’occuper au plus vite de la migration des données de l’entreprise sur le logiciel Odoo, le contrat relatif aux licenses doit avoir été négocié dans la semaine qui suit le début de la phase d’implémentation.  La société istarii srl n’a aucun pouvoir décisionnaire sur le prix de ces licences. Un calculateur de prix est disponible publiquement à cette adresse: https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/pricing,  bien qu’il n’ait aucune valeur contractuelle.  Il est bon de rappeler que le prix total des licences sera fonction du nombre d’utilisateur, du nombre de modules utilisés ainsi que de la durée de la souscription aux licenses.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n6. Acceptation\\n\\n\\n En approuvant la mission décrite dans ce document, Le client certifie également avoir pris connaissance et accepté les conditions générales de ventes de la sociétés istarii srl, disponible sur demande ainsi que publiquement à l’adresse suivante https://www.istarii.com/conditions-generales-vente/. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFait à XX le XX en deux exemplaires, un pour le Client et un pour istarii srl.\\n\\n\\nNom et Signature du Client                                                Signature istarii srl\\n(à précéder de la mention “lu et approuvé”)\")]\n",

      "[Document(metadata={'source': 'Strategic meeting July 2020', 'file_type': 'text/plain'}, page_content='\\ufeffStrategic meeting for istarii \\nby Florian Vanhee\\n(July 2020)\\n\\n\\nPreamble \\n\\n\\nAs we have done it quite sometimes now, I think it is time to reflect on the bigger picture for istarii and see what strategic moves we can do to address the principal issues on our road. I’m taking advantage of a week-off from day-to-day management to take some heights and to write this doc, yet it still only is my opinion that is reflected below.\\n\\n\\nAt the moment, there is a need to go to the next level in terms of revenue as well as in terms of perspectives for the future. The past year was spent mostly gaining expertise in the operational aspect of the business and by that I mean the day-to-day management of the company but also the management on a project level. Nonetheless, there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the future of the company, which in my opinion, comes down to 2 different and yet related domains; Customer Acquisition and the Area(s) of expertise or Problem Solving.\\n\\n\\n Indeed, the lack of opportunities for istarii means that it is hard to make plans for the future and this difficulty to find customers or more exactly a customer audience is partially linked to the fact we are trying to solve different problems for different types of customers. It is my understanding that we should gain knowledge about these 2 aspects in a lean way so that we can eventually see a more stable / predictable way forward. Fortunately, we have already acquired quite a bit of knowledge on various area(s) of expertise, more specifically regarding the ratio: effort*boringness / reward. One might be surprise by the addition of the boring value in the equation, but my experience tells me that:\\n1. It is a long and difficult journey to become really profitable\\n2. It requires efficient work and smart problem solving ideas\\n3. The difficulty of holding the two first assumptions together depends on the boringness of the job at hand\\n\\n\\nI also believe that the way to acquire customers will be strongly related to the area or areas of expertise and therefore, for an area we choose to learn, it will dictate the initial angles for learning the customer acquisition.\\n\\n\\nTo conclude this preamble, I’d like to say that we should take Delhaize’s project and Yves’s project for what they are, hypothetical jobs. This means we should not include them into our plans for the future. Because we need to think of a way forward now, and we cannot arguably wait one or two months to see them cancelled. If they happen, that’s nice, we might have the luxury of making choices and having some bargaining power.\\n\\n\\nArea(s) of expertise \\n\\n\\nHere is a list of the different area of expertise that I could think of where we could reasonably offer something of value: \\n\\n\\n* Website / E-commerce by cms\\n* Website / E-commerce by code\\n* Digital marketing & SEO\\n* Final user related application through a customer\\n* Final user related application directly under our control\\n   * Utilities\\n   * E-commerce (AI-ART, ..)\\n   * Video games\\n   * Innovative\\n* Internal processes related application through a customer\\n* Internal processes related application directly under our control\\n* Auditing\\n* Manpower (consulting)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI won’t say what we should or should not do, that is left to discuss between us, but it is certain we cannot learn about all of them at the same time. \\n\\n\\nIt must be said that we are learning a lot regarding the technical skills required in some of these areas and while it is obviously valuable to deliver actual value to a client, we should reflect on them based on their ability to fit a viable business model for us. We should also value the learning of technical skills properly in regards to the whole business model and not place them on pedestal. Learning = money (now or in the future). Learning what matters and learning as efficiently as possible as a whole is thus the key to profitability. At our stage, everything we do is learning, even working on a client’s project. It means we have to balance the monetary value and the learning value the project brings with the learning value of other activities. In a perfect world we would have equations and metrics, here we mostly have to rely on common sense. \\n\\n\\nCustomer Acquisition \\n\\n\\nThe domain where we are the most is in the dark is certainly customer acquisition. We have not taken advantage of all those months to properly understand the market. This means, we don’t know how to reach our audience, how desperate it is to get its problem solved ,what it is ready to pay and that is true regarding ANY area of expertise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing, is a list of “techniques” we should do to start learning on the matter:\\n\\n\\n* Approaching Client in a proactive manner\\n   * Preparing prototype (if problem known in advance)\\n   * Attending to seminars\\n   * Emailing + calling -> getting a response\\n* Finding client where the market for our expertise is good, potentially not belgium (Thibault think about the kiné en guadeloupe / guyanne, we also have the power of remote working)\\n* Selling the solution to a customer’s problem without interaction\\n* Selling / giving (+ads) to final user (publishing on app stores)\\n* Reaching people out on social media by ads\\n* Reaching people out on linkedin (all the crazy people that are spamming us)\\n* Using our personal network / previous clients\\n\\n\\nIt is my opinion that at the moment customer acquisition is the place where we can learn the most at the moment and we should focus most of our attention on it. As I said earlier, the knowledge for customer acquisition is strongly related to a specific area of expertise. Therefore, the learning of customer acquisition can only be done by building and testing several (sub-)business models each focusing on one specific area.\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, it might be easier to test different techniques of customer acquisition than to test different areas of expertise as it required some adaptation time + project time. The results are also easily quantifiable and the feedback might also come quickly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n\\nThe goal of this modest document is to make all the actors of istarii reflect on the challenges ahead of us and offer the very first basics to take action. What I like with the learning paradigm is that it shows that the absence (or scarcity) of monetary value at some point doesn’t mean the company is not progressing. And the opposite is true as well, bringing money is not necessarily a sign of progress. It highlights some pitfalls we had during the F&P project where we stopped learning about anything other than the project itself, mostly impacting our customer acquisition knowledge (which wasn’t ideal).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nP-S: Let’s be smart, my monaco flat is waiting for me. And I’m sure it’s the case for Tim as well :)')]\n",

Une période transitoire de 3 ans a \\ndébuté le 1er décembre 2017 et prendra fin le 1er décembre 2020.\\nPendant cette période transitoire, vous avez encore la possibilité de racheter vos années d’études suivant les « anciennes » \\nrègles. Les conditions et les modalités sont différentes de celles applicables dans la « nouvelle » réglementation introduite en \\n2017. \\nLa cotisation pour le rachat d’une année d’étude dans la nouvelle réglementation est déterminée de manière forfaitaire \\n(1.560,52 € par an) pour les périodes d’étude situées à partir du 1er janvier de l’année du 20e anniversaire. Les périodes d’étude \\nsituées avant le 1er janvier de l’année du 20e anniversaire sont quant à elles calculées de manière actuarielle. \\nLes cotisations calculées selon la méthode actuarielle sont généralement nettement plus élevées que les cotisations \\nforfaitaires.  \\nA partir du 1er décembre, vous ne pourrez donc plus recourir à l’ancien régime. En outre, la cotisation forfaitaire sera appliquée \\nuniquement pour les demandes introduites dans les 10 ans suivant l’obtention du dernier diplôme qui entre en considération \\npour un rachat. Passé ce délai, une cotisation actuarielle sera calculée.\\nLa cotisation versée pour le rachat des années d’études est déductible fiscalement au titre de charge professionnelle pour \\nl’année durant laquelle vous effectuez le paiement. \\nChaque année d’études que vous rachetez vous permet d’augmenter le montant brut de votre pension. Vous vous demandez \\nsi cette possibilité de rachat de vos années d’étude est intéressante pour vous ? \\nN’attendez plus et consultez mypension.be afin de calculer l’impact de ce rachat sur votre pension.')]\n",

L’indemnité de soutien à la reprise\\nLes indépendants qui reprennent leurs activités après les avoir temporairement interrompues dans le cadre de la crise \\ndu Coronavirus pourront bénéficier d’une aide supplémentaire. Cette aide prendra la forme d’une indemnité de soutien \\ntemporaire pour la période du mois de juin à août. \\nPour bénéficier de cette mesure temporaire, des conditions sont établies :\\n• Votre activité indépendante était encore interdite ou limitée le 3 mai dernier ;\\n• Elle peut à nouveau être exercée sur tout le mois civil, sans restrictions autre que celle de la distanciation sociale ;\\n• Vous devez démontrer une baisse du chiﬀres d’aﬀaires ou des commandes d’au moins 10% par rapport au même \\ntrimestre de 2019 ; \\n• Vous ne bénéficiez pas du droit passerelle pour le mois sur lequel porte la demande. \\nLe montant de la prestation mensuelle est identique à celle du droit passerelle.\\nPour en savoir plus, consultez aussi notre article sur https://bit.ly/3iCOsjA \\nVous pouvez aussi faire votre demande d’indemnité via notre formulaire en ligne sur https://sforce.co/32e81sO\\n2. Le droit passerelle \\nLa mesure temporaire du droit passerelle est prolongée pour les mois de juillet et août pour tous les indépendants qui ne \\nsont pas en mesure de reprendre leurs activités :\\n• Soit votre activité indépendante relève d’un des secteurs qui sont encore explicitement visés par les mesures de \\nfermeture imposées par le gouvernement ou dépend de ces secteurs et vous êtes toujours obligés de l’interrompre.\\n• Soit votre activité indépendante n’est pas explicitement visée par les mesures de fermeture, mais vous êtes contraint \\nd’interrompre complètement votre activité pendant au moins 7 jours civils consécutifs. Dans ce cas, vous devez \\ndémontrer clairement un lien de causalité entre l’interruption et le COVID-19 (exemple : une activité déficitaire ne \\npermettant pas d’avoir un revenu suﬀisant). \\nSi vous vous trouvez dans une de ces situations, introduisez votre demande via notre formulaire en ligne sur  \\nhttps://sforce.co/321xhCO ou consultez notre article dédié sur https://bit.ly/2Z30v23\\n3.

Ces cotisations seront\\négalement revues ultérieurement sur la base des revenus indépendants réels de l’année concernée, même\\nincomplète, retenus fiscalement (revenus bruts moins charges professionnelles) Ce principe est valable pour\\nchaque année d’activité tout au long de la carrière comme indépendant.\\nEstimez correctement votre revenu de l’année en cours\\nSur  base du principe légal de calcul de cotisations en vigueur au 1er janvier 2019, il est primordial d’estimer\\nau plus juste vos revenus indépendants de l’année en cours.\\nEn effet, dans le cadre d’une demande de réduction de cotisations provisoires accordée, si l’estimation des\\nrevenus n’est pas en phase avec  les revenus réels, lors de la régularisation sur base des revenus\\ncommuniqués par l’Administration des Contributions,  vous serez pénalisé de majorations trimestrielles de 3\\n% ainsi que d’une majoration annuelle unique de 7 % calculées sur le supplément de cotisations sociales.\\nPayez à temps\\nVotre cotisation est considérée comme payée le jour où son montant est porté au crédit de notre compte. Si\\nnotre compte n’est pas crédité le dernier jour ouvrable du trimestre, nous serons légalement obligés\\nde vous compter des majorations, de 3% par trimestre de retard. En outre, au 1er janvier, les cotisations\\nimpayées qui vous ont été comptées pour la première fois au cours de l’année précédente, se voient appliquer\\nune majoration annuelle supplémentaire de 7%.\\nVeillez à effectuer votre paiement à la date indiquée sur ce document ou, mieux encore, à faire usage d’une\\ndomiciliation bancaire.

J’ai choisi Fahrenheit 451 de Ray Bradbury édition Gallimard, 240 pages, Année de publication : 2000, collection Folio-SF, ISBN : 9782070415731.\\n________________\\nJugement de goût (204 mots) \\n\\n\\nFahrenheit 451 de Ray Bradbury est un livre qui m’a beaucoup fait réfléchir. L’histoire se passe dans un futur alternatif aux États-Unis, où les livres sont interdits et brûlés. J’aborderai ici les deux éléments du livres qui m’ont le plus marqués.                                \\nPremièrement, j’ai été étonné par la justesse des prédictions technologiques parmi lesquelles, on retrouve les “coquillages” qui font penser aux AirPods et les gants qui identifient notre main pour nous laisser rentrer alors même que nous utilisons de plus en plus notre empreinte digitale.\\nDeuxièmement, Par leur absence de cet univers dystopique, Ray Bradbury nous montre l’importance de la culture, de la réflexion, des différences de pensées et plus globalement de l’éducation. On peut, par exemple, facilement faire le parallèle entre le mur-écran avec leurs jeux concours sans réflexion et les émissions de télé-réalité qui prennent une place toujours plus considérable dans notre vie.\\nConclusion, Fahrenheit 451 nous expose un monde inquiétant mais pourtant assez proche du nôtre et l’on peut s’imaginer qu’un basculement de l’un vers l’autre n’est jamais très loin. Ce livre est donc une bonne piqûre de rappel que je recommande à tous.\\n________________\\n\\n\\nRésumé narratif (217 mots)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuy Montag est un pompier chargé de brûler des livres, dans un futur alternatif où ceux-ci sont interdits et où la guerre semble imminente. Durant une intervention, Montag voit une femme qui préfère brûler avec ses livres plutôt que de les abandonner. Perturbé, il demande à un vieil homme nommé Faber, qui était un professeur d’anglais avant l’interdiction des livres, de l’aider à comprendre ces derniers.\\n En rentrant chez lui un soir, il tombe sur Mildred, sa femme, et ses amies en train de regarder le mur-écran, une sorte de télévision, dans le salon. Montag, en ayant assez de cette superficialité, s'énerve et leur lit un passage d’un livre. \\n En allant en mission, Montag remarque que c’est sa maison qui est suspectée de contenir des livres. Beatty, son supérieur, lui annonce que c’est sa femme qui l’a dénoncé. Il est donc contraint de brûler sa maison et est mis au sol par ses collègues qui procèdent à son arrestation mais il finit par s’échapper en tuant Beatty. Montag va alors voir Faber qui lui propose de rejoindre un groupe de marginaux mémorisant des livres et habitant en dehors de la ville. Peu après les avoir rejoint, il voit la ville se faire bombarder.\")]\n",

Jeanne d’Arc s’impose d’elle-même comme femme guerrière et courageuse et bien que sa vie fut courte, son histoire a traversé les siècles. Ce résumé parlera de ses origines, de ses faits d’armes, son désaveu mais aussi de sa réhabilitation quelques décennies plus tard.\\nJeanne d’Arc est née en France aux environs de 1412 à Domrémy dans une famille de laboureurs, des paysans relativement aisés pour l’époque. Elle eut une enfance très pieuse. C’est aussi pendant cette période qu’elle aurait commencé à entendre des voix. Celles-ci lui auraient demandé de ramener le Dauphin Charles sur le trône et de libérer la France de la présence anglaise.\\nDéterminée à faire ce que les voix lui disaient, Jeanne se décida à partir à la rencontre du Dauphin. Bien qu’inconnue de tous, elle fit vite parler d’elle, en prédisant l’issue d’une bataille qui eut lieu pendant le siège d’Orléans et ce avant que les messagers ne rapportent l'événement. Elle réussit donc à obtenir une audience avec le Dauphin. Elle lui raconte les voix qu’elle entend et Charles lui fait subir différents interrogatoires sur sa foi mais aussi sur sa virginité. Le Dauphin accepte alors de lui confier une armée pour libérer Orléans des Anglais. Du 7 au 8 mai 1429, Jeanne d’Arc remporte la victoire contre les Anglais. Le 17 juillet 1429, Charles y est couronné roi de France et prend le nom de Charles VII.\\n                                \\nAprès cela, Jeanne d’Arc marche pour libérer Paris mais perd la bataille et est faite prisonnière pour ensuite se faire emmener au tribunal de Rouen. Après un long procès, où il est dit que les témoignages de nombreux docteurs et religieux furent obtenus dans une atmosphère de terreur générale, Jeanne est condamnée à mort. Les principales accusations sont d’avoir menti sur les voix célestes qu’elle dit avoir entendues et de porter des habits d’homme. Jeanne d'Arc est finalement brûlée vive sur la place du Vieux-Marché à Rouen, le 30 mai 1431.\\nDurant les années qui suivirent, le peuple français et même le roi Charles VII vont dénoncer ce “faux” procès orchestré par les anglais. Ils vont aussi s’en prendre à tous ceux qui y ont pris part, comme le duc de Bourgogne qui livra Jeanne aux Anglais. Enfin, en 1455, le Pape Calixte III demande une révision du procès. Il en découle donc un nouveau procès qui va finir par casser le précédent jugement, réhabilitant ainsi Jeanne d’Arc qui sera par la suite l’objet de nombreux récits, poèmes et oeuvres d’art incarnant l’image de la femme guerrière qui fut envoyée par dieu pour libérer la France des Anglais.\\n\\n\\nSources :\\n\\n\\nBEAUNE, Colette.

Un quelconque retard de paiement entraîne le retrait systématique du\\nmatériel mis en location, et ce, sans avertissement de notre part et aux frais exclusifs du contractant.\\nPour les locations de week-end et ou festivités, le paiement se fait à 100 % avant le début de la location.\\nHormis pour les groupes électrogènes la facturation s’établira toujours pour au moins 28 jours calendrier,\\nmême si la durée de la location est inférieure à 28 jours calendrier.\\nLa durée de la période de location est stipulée clairement par le contractant avant la prise en location du\\nmatériel.

Toute redevance, taxe\\nou autre montant de quelque nature qu'il soit qui pourrait être réclamé pour l'occupation du domaine\\npublic ou tout simplement par le placement de l'objet loué sur l'assiette du domaine public est dû par le\\nlocataire, à l'entière décharge de LOCASIX.\\n \\nArticle VI : Livraison\\n- Les délais de livraison ne sont fixés qu'à titre purement indicatif, et sans aucune garantie.

insurance policyholder with the insurer via the intermediary of the administrator. \\nThe administrator is responsible for the sale of the insurance contract. \\nThe insurer is responsible for the administration of the insurance contract as well as the management of claims and can, if \\nnecessary, entrust all or part of the responsibility to the administrator and the claims manager. \\nIt is the responsibility of the insurer to cover the insured benefit. \\nHow to contact the administrator concerning the insurance contract? \\nYou can contact the administrator from Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm by telephone at +32 2 588 25 50 or by e-mail at \\ncontact@qover.com. \\nAny letters can be sent to QOVER SA, Rue du Commerce 31, 1000 Brussels, Belgium. \\nWe record all communications, including telephone calls, in order to improve the quality of services as well as for training or \\nfraud detection purposes. \\nWhat does your insurance contract consist of? \\nYour insurance contract consists of two parts : \\n1. The General Conditions (this document), which describe the damages that we cover, those that we do not cover and the \\nreciprocal obligations of the parties ; \\n2. The Policy Schedule, which contain the terms that concern you in particular. The provisions cited in the Policy Schedule \\ntake precedence over the General Conditions. You will receive this document during the period that the insurance is \\ntaken out, during any amendments and during the annual extension of the insurance contract. \\nWhat is the legal framework ?  \\nThis insurance contract falls within the scope of the Law of 4 April 2014 relating to insurance as well as the decrees and \\nregulations made in performance of the cited law. This insurance contract also includes the minimum conditions of compulsory \\ninsurance contracts for liability for motor vehicles – (as listed in the Annex to the Royal Decree of 16 April 2018 determining the \\nconditions of obligatory insurance contracts for motor vehicles). \\nThis policy covers in the Motor third party liability cover the repair of the damages resulting from an act of terrorism, in \\naccordance with the Law of 1 April 2007 relating to insurance against damages caused by terrorism. \\nThis insurance contract also falls within the scope of national, European and international regulations relating to financial \\nsanctions. These regulations prohibit us from entering into contracts with or for the benefit of (legal) persons appearing on \\nnational and/or international lists (financial sanctions lists) because they have committed violations of international peace and \\nsecurity (for example, acts of terrorism), human rights violations or because they have participated in the proliferation of \\nweapons of mass destruction or money laundering or related crimes. We regularly check whether this is the case or not. If, \\nwithin ten days of concluding the insurance contract, it turns out that you (the insurance policyholder) are on a sanction list, the \\ninsurance contract will no longer be valid. If you, the insurance policyholder or the Insured party or a third party, appear on a \\nsanction list during the period of validity of the insurance contract, this (legal) person will not benefit from any intervention in \\nthe context of a claim, any other service and any valid insurance. \\nWe make every effort to translate the legal provisions as understandably as possible. If any clause of this insurance contract \\nconflicts with the aforementioned legal provisions, the latter take precedence.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 22.1.117', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 22 pour Word', 'creationdate': '2022-04-06T18:12:59+02:00', 'author': 'Utilisateur de Microsoft Office', 'comments': '', 'company': 'Endurance', 'contenttypeid': '0x0101003BBFABB8DC32C74BA77D3205572E13F4', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2022-04-06T18:13:18+02:00', 'sourcemodified': 'D:20220406161252', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'source': 'generalConditions.pdf', 'total_pages': 55, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7', 'file_type': 'application/pdf'}, page_content=\"Qover - Rue du Commerce, 31 - 1000 Brussels, Belgium - Qover SA - Unaffiliated insurance agent - FSMA under number 0650.939.878 - Trade Register 0650.939.878. 7 \\nWhich courts have jurisdiction in the event of litigation concerning this \\ninsurance contract? \\nOnly the Belgian courts are competent in the event of litigation concerning this insurance contract, this contract shall be subject \\nto Belgian law.  \\nWhere do you need to be domiciled to take out and benefit from the \\ninsurance? \\nYou (the insurance policyholder as a natural person or as a legal person) must be domiciled/have your registered office or your \\nplace of business in Belgium in order to be able to take out this insurance.  \\nWhen does your insurance contract come into effect ? \\nThe insurance contract comes into effect on the date cited in your Policy Schedule. \\nThe deadlines for premiums are cited in your Policy Schedule.  \\nHow is your premium calculated ?  \\nThe premium a priori \\nThe premium (details of the composition can be found in your Policy Schedule) is set according to pricing criteria.  \\nThe premium is adjusted to the new situation should these criteria be amended. \\nThe premium a posteriori \\nThe premium is personalised, a posteriori, depending, in particular, on the combined effect of claims occurring during previous \\ninsurance periods and the number of kilometres travelled using the designated insured vehicle. In the event of incorrect \\napplication of the premium amendment system based on the aforementioned criteria, the insurer makes the necessary \\ncorrections and, if necessary, re-imburses the policyholder or claims from them the difference in premium resulting from these \\ncorrections. When the adjustment is made more than one year after the incorrect premium has been set, the amount re-\\nimbursed by the insurer is increased by the legal interest. This legal interest begins to run from the moment the incorrect \\npremium has been collected. \\nThe insurer will adjust the personalised premium if the policyholder declares an amendment of one of the segmentation \\nparameters (claims and kilometres travelled) and/or if the insurer finds that one of said parameters does not correspond to the \\npolicyholder's declarations. \\nNote that if you are comparing different insurance contracts, you cannot only compare the estimated costs and fees of the \\ncontracts but you must also take into account other elements, such as the scope of the covers, the amount of any excess or the \\nexclusion clauses. \\nThe estimates cited in your Policy Schedule give a better idea of the part of the premium used to cover the risk covered by the \\ninsurance contract. \\nThe balance of the premium, after deduction of taxes as well as acquisition and administration costs, consists of the part of the \\npremium used for the performance of contractually agreed benefits and costs other than those cited in your Policy Schedule \\n(including the combined and mutually shared costs of the claims and their handling). These estimates for acquisition and \\nadministrative costs, are being calculated on the basis of accounting data for the last financial year of the insurer as approved \\nby its Annual General Meeting. \\nAre the insured amounts and the premium automatically adjusted? \\nFor this insurance, the insured amounts and the premium are not indexed.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 22.1.117', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 22 pour Word', 'creationdate': '2022-04-06T18:12:59+02:00', 'author': 'Utilisateur de Microsoft Office', 'comments': '', 'company': 'Endurance', 'contenttypeid': '0x0101003BBFABB8DC32C74BA77D3205572E13F4', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2022-04-06T18:13:18+02:00', 'sourcemodified': 'D:20220406161252', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'source': 'generalConditions.pdf', 'total_pages': 55, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8', 'file_type': 'application/pdf'}, page_content='Qover - Rue du Commerce, 31 - 1000 Brussels, Belgium - Qover SA - Unaffiliated insurance agent - FSMA under number 0650.939.878 - Trade Register 0650.939.878. 8 \\nPrescription \\nAny action deriving from this agreement is prescribed within a period of three (3) years from the event giving rise to it. \\nWhat should you do in the event of a claim? \\nA.

Si une surprime médicale est imputée pour l'assurance solde d'emprunt en raison d'un risque\\nde santé accru qui dépasse un certain seuil minimum, le mécanisme de compensation veillera à ce que le surplus ne doive pas\\nêtre payé par le preneur d'assurance, mais qu'il soit pris en charge par la caisse de compensation. Le preneur d'assurance ne\\ndoit pas demander explicitement l'intervention de la caisse de compensation. La compagnie d'assurances qui impose une\\nsurprime médicale dépassant le seuil s'adresse directement à elle pour récupérer le surplus.

Il vérifiera notamment ses exigences et besoins, ainsi que\\nl'étendue de la couverture, la volonté de déduire fiscalement les primes.\\nCette simulation est basée sur une assurance d’une durée similaire au crédit mentionné, dont le montant mentionné dans la\\nrubrique “couverture” diminue dans une mesure similaire au crédit encore dû, en supposant que le taux du crédit reste inchangé\\ndurant toute sa durée.\\nUne assurance Solde Restant Dû de AG Insurance est une assurance décès (branche 21).

A partir du moment où le tarif social \\nest appliqué, le Client bénéficiera de ce tarif spécifique et les conditions particulières liées à ce tarif lui \\nseront applicables.\\n6.5 Le Client s’engage à payer intégralement et en temps utile ses factures d’acompte et de régularisation \\nannuelle ou finale.\\n6.6 Lampiris s’engage à fournir de l’énergie au Client conformément aux dispositions du Contrat et aux \\nréglementations régionale et fédérale applicables.\\n6.7 Le Client informera Lampiris immédiatement de tout élément dont il a connaissance pouvant \\nmodifier, empêcher ou compliquer l’exécution du présent Contrat. En cas d’omission de cette obligation \\nd’information, Lampiris peut résilier le Contrat moyennant le respect d’un préavis de trente (30) jours\\nArticle 7 - Facturation, paiement et résiliation\\n7.1 Pour la détermination de la quantité d’énergie livrée, Lampiris se base sur les données de mesure et \\nprofils de consommation fournis par le Gestionnaire de réseau à partir des données relevées ou estimée \\npar le Gestionnaire de réseau ou des données de consommation fournies par le client et validées par le \\nGestionnaire de réseau.\\nCONDITIONS GÉNÉRALES DE VENTE'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'macOS Version 11.1 (Build 20C69) Quartz PDFContext, AppendMode 1.1', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': \"D:20200703122129Z00'00'\", 'trapped': '/False', 'moddate': \"D:20210119122508Z00'00'\", 'source': 'Contract_Florian_Vanhee.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4', 'file_type': 'application/pdf'}, page_content='7.2 Le Client est redevable d’acomptes sur l’électricité et/ou le gaz naturel qui lui est fourni. Lampiris \\ndétermine le montant de ces acomptes en fonction du profil de consommation du Client déterminé par \\nle Gestionnaire de réseau et en informe le client avant la facturation effective de cet acompte ainsi que \\nlors de chaque changement. Le Client peut demander à Lampiris de revoir le montant des acomptes. \\nLampiris répond à cette demande dans un délai de 10 jours ouvrables maximum et motive sa réponse. \\nSi la demande d’adaptation est déraisonnable, Lampiris a le droit de la refuser, en motivant le refus. \\nLampiris n’est pas responsables des différences observées entre la consommation effective du Client et \\nla consommation estimée qui a été prise en compte pour le calcul de l’acompte.\\n7.3 L e  p a i e m e n t  d e s  a c o m p t e s  e t  d e s  f a c t u r e s  d e  r é g u l a r i s a t i o n  s e  f a i t ,  a u  c h o i x  d u  C l i e n t ,  s o i t  p a r  \\nvirement, soit par domiciliation.

Si le Client a choisi de payer ses factures par domiciliation, un délai de 15 jours \\nsera également respecté avant que l’ordre de domiciliation soit exécuté.\\n7.5 Les factures sont présumées acceptées en l’absence de contestation dans les quinze jours qui suivent \\nleur réception. Par exception, chaque Client pourra contester une facture erronée pendant une période \\nde 12 mois à compter de la date de réception de la facture. En cas de contestation raisonnablement \\nfondée d’une facture, chaque Client est autorisé à suspendre le paiement de la partie contestée de ladite \\nfacture jusqu’à ce que le traitement de la plainte soit finalisé. Dans le cas d’une facturation erronée réelle \\nen la défaveur du Client, les intérêts légaux sur les sommes à rembourser seront également portés en \\ncompte, à dater du jour du paiement du montant erronément facturé.\\n7.6 Le paiement tardif d’une facture ou le non-respect d’un plan d’apurement entraîne l’exigibilité \\nimmédiate de toutes les autres factures se rapportant à la même énergie, même si un délai de paiement \\na été octroyé ou un plan d’apurement a été mis en place, sans mise en demeure préalable. Si à un \\nmoment quelconque, une ou plusieurs factures sont échues, tout paiement effectué ensuite par le Client \\nest porté en compte à la date de la dernière facture émise et non payée.\\nSans préjudice des dispositions légales, Lampiris peut imputer des frais administratifs et/ou des intérêts \\npour l’envoi de factures supplémentaires, de duplicata, de rappels, de mises en demeure, pour la mise \\nen place d’un plan d’apurement suite à un retard de paiement ou si la présentation d’une domiciliation \\nest refusée par la banque.\\nLe coût s’élève à 7,5 EUR pour un envoi par courrier ordinaire et à 15 EUR pour un envoi par courrier \\nrecommandé.

Lampiris n’en est dès lors pas responsable. En cas d’interruption \\nde la distribution ou du transport d’électricité et/ou de gaz naturel, Lampiris a le droit de limiter \\nou d’interrompre la fourniture via les réseaux de transport ou de distribution concernés, sans être \\nredevable au Client de la moindre indemnité. Le Client peut s’adresser directement à son Gestionnaire \\nde réseau en cas de dommages résultant d’une interruption, d’une limitation ou d’une irrégularité de \\nson alimentation en énergie.\\n11.2 Sans préjudice de ce qui précède, la responsabilité de Lampiris et du Client n’est engagée que pour \\n(i) les dommages matériels directs résultant d’une faute grave ou intentionnelle ou de l’inexécution de \\ntoute prestation principale figurant dans le présent contrat et (ii) le décès ou les dommages corporels \\nrésultant d’un acte ou d’une omission. L’indemnisation des dommages matériels directs est limitée par \\nsinistre à un montant équivalent à 12 fois le montant déterminé comme acompte mensuel, sans que ce \\nmontant ne puisse dépasser le montant effectivement facturé au cours des 12 derniers mois. Lampiris \\net le Client ne sont pas responsables l’un envers l’autre des dommages indirects ou consécutifs, d’une \\nperte de production, d’un manque à gagner ou d’une perte de revenus.\\n11.3 Toute demande de dommages et intérêts doit être notifiée à l’autre partie, par écrit, dans les 30 \\njours ouvrables à compter de la date de la survenance du dommage ou de la date où le dommage aurait \\nraisonnablement pu être constaté. Toute demande de dommages et intérêts introduite après ce délai \\nn’ouvrira pas droit à indemnisation.\\n11.4 Si la responsabilité de Lampiris devait être mise en cause pour vices cachés au sens des articles \\n1641 à 1649 du Code civil, cette responsabilité est en tout cas exclue si Lampiris arrive à démontrer que \\nle vice était indécelable.\\n11.5 Le présent article s’applique tous droits saufs des dispositions régionales en matière d’indemnisation.\\n(Pour les clients en région wallonne, voir : http://www.indemnisations-energie.be).\\nArticle 12 - Cession\\n12.1 Lampiris a le droit de céder le Contrat à une autre personne, pour autant que celle-ci respecte les \\ndispositions légales en matière de fourniture d’électricité ou de gaz naturel et dispose des autorisations \\nnécessaires et dans la mesure où les conditions mentionnées dans le présent Contrat sont maintenues \\npour toute la durée du Contrat.\\n12.2 Le Client ne peut céder le Contrat à un tiers qu’en cas de déménagement et moyennant le respect \\ndes conditions de l’article 13.1.

En \\ncas de contestation sur les index de référence au moment du déménagement, Lampiris se réserve \\nle droit de demander la communication du DRE dûment complété et signé. En l’absence d’une telle \\ncommunication, les index prévalant sont ceux dont la validité a été confirmée par le Gestionnaire de \\nréseau. Le DRE est disponible sur le site www.Lampiris.be.\\n13.2 Après le déménagement, le présent Contrat continuera à être exécuté pour le nouveau Point de \\nfourniture à la nouvelle adresse du Client, sauf si le Client déménage à l’étranger ou dans une autre \\nrégion ou s’il déménage dans une habitation où il n’y a pas de compteur séparé ou s’il va habiter chez un \\nautre Consommateur qui a déjà conclu un autre contrat de fourniture. Dans les cas susmentionnés, il \\npourra être mis fin anticipativement au Contrat moyennant le respect d’un délai de préavis de 30 jours.\\nSi le Client n’informe pas Lampiris du déménagement dans les délais prévus, il reste tenu de ses \\nobligations conformément au présent Contrat et, en particulier, il restera tenu de payer toute l’électricité \\nou le gaz naturel consommés au Point de fourniture existant, peu importe par qui, jusqu’au lendemain \\ndu jour auquel le déménagement a été communiqué à Lampiris ou jusqu’au jour suivant la clôture du \\ncompteur en application de l’article 13.3.\\n13.3 Si le Client ne respecte pas les obligations qui lui incombent en vertu de l’article 13.1, des présentes \\nConditions générales, le Client mandate irrévocablement Lampiris pour qu’elle demande la clôture du \\ncompteur au Gestionnaire de réseau dans le respect des dispositions légales en la matière. Le Client \\nest responsable de tous les frais liés à cette de la clôture qui seraient facturés à Lampiris et Lampiris \\nn’assume aucune responsabilité pour le dommage qui pourrait en découler.\\nArticle 14 – Modification des Conditions \\n14.1 Les présentes Conditions générales et la Carte tarifaire qui vous sont applicables ne peuvent être \\nmodifiées :\\n- Si les modifications sont en défaveur du Client : (i) qu’au terme de la période de fourniture en cours, \\nsi le Client a conclu un contrat à durée déterminée. Dans ce cas, Lampiris communique au Client les \\nmodifications apportées aux présentes Conditions générales au moins 2 mois avant la fin de la période \\nen cours et ces modifications ne peuvent entrer en vigueur qu’au moment du renouvellement ou de la \\nprolongation du contrat en cours ; (ii) que deux mois après la communication au Client des modifications \\napportées aux présentes Conditions générales si celui-ci a conclu un contrat à durée indéterminée.\\n- Si les modifications ne sont pas en défaveur du Client : que deux mois après une communication au \\nClient, quel que soit le type de contrat conclu ;\\nPar dérogation, les modifications sont directement applicables dans le cas où elles résultent directement \\nou indirectement d’une décision d’une autorité publique.\\nCette communication peut se faire par tous les moyens habituels de communication entre Lampiris et le \\nClient, par exemple par le biais d’une mention sur la facture.\\n14.2 Le Client qui n’est pas d’accord avec les Conditions générales modifiées qui ont été communiquées \\npeut mettre fin au contrat sans préavis et sans frais, en envoyant un courrier recommandé dans le mois \\nqui suit la communication des Conditions générales modifiées.\\nCette résiliation sera effective le lendemain de la réception de la lettre recommandée de résiliation. \\nJusqu’à ce moment, les anciennes conditions restent applicables.

Vous devez \\nle compléter afin de relever à un ‘instant T’ l’index des compteurs d’électricité et de \\ngaz naturel. Il n’est donc pas possible de reprendre le contrat d’énergie de quelqu’un \\nd’autre. Lors de votre déménagement, vous pouvez soit conclure un nouveau contrat \\npour l’électricité et le gaz naturel soit décider de poursuivre votre contrat de fourniture \\nà votre nouvelle adresse. Mais ce n’est pas via le document de reprise des énergies que \\nvous devez marquer votre choix.\\nLorsque vous déménagez, vous devez remplir le document de reprise des énergies \\npour votre ancienne ET votre nouvelle adresse et ce, à chaque fois en deux exemplaires :  \\nun pour vous-même et l’autre pour le locataire ou propriétaire. Les deux parties \\ndoivent soigneusement compléter ET signer le document. Chaque partie envoie \\nensuite une copie de son document à son ou ses fournisseurs d’énergie.\\nLe document de reprise des énergies a une valeur juridique. En cas de litige ultérieur \\nsur les index relevés, le fournisseur d’énergie peut réclamer ce document en tant que \\npreuve. Vous devez donc toujours conserver l’original !\\nAlors que certains fournisseurs acceptent de régler la transmission des index lors d’un \\ndéménagement par téléphone, il est néanmoins toujours conseillé de compléter le \\ndocument de reprise des énergies.

Celui-ci peut être simple, bihoraire \\nou exclusif nuit :\\n- Le compteur simple n’a qu’un cadran chiffré. Vous payez le même prix pour toute \\nl’électricité consommée. \\n- Le compteur bihoraire a deux cadrans chiffrés. Le compteur jour mesure votre \\nconsommation durant la journée et le compteur nuit mesure la consommation durant \\nla nuit et le weekend. Le prix est différent pour ces deux périodes.\\n- Le compteur exclusif nuit enregistre la consommation via un circuit séparé et n’est \\nraccordé qu’à des installations de chauffage. Ce circuit est actif uniquement la nuit. Ce \\ncompteur n’a qu’un cadran chiffré.\\nLe compteur numérique ou compteur électronique se distingue du compteur \\nélectromécanique par le fait que les éléments mécaniques, tels que l’affichage, sont \\nremplacés par des parties électroniques. Toutes les informations sont affichées sur un \\nécran. Le compteur double flux ou compteur bidirectionnel est un compteur numérique \\nqui permet de mesurer séparément les énergies prélevées et injectées sur le réseau \\nlorsque vous disposez d’une installation de production d’énergies renouvelables  \\n(p.ex. panneaux photovoltaïques).\\nLe compteur intelligent (ou compteur smart) est un compteur double flux/\\nbidirectionnel doté d’une interface de communication (communication du compteur \\ndu client vers son gestionnaires de réseaux), et ajoutant de nouvelles fonctionnalités \\ncomme par exemple la relève à distance des index.\\nVous ne devrez pas changer de compteur si vous changez de fournisseur.\\nQUELS SONT LES RISQUES SI JE NE RESPECTE PAS LA PROCÉDURE DE \\nDÉMÉNAGEMENT\\xa0?\\nSi vous n’informez pas votre fournisseur d’énergie de votre déménagement, la \\nconsommation d’énergie pour votre ancienne adresse continuera à vous être facturée \\naprès votre déménagement.\\nSi vous ne signalez pas correctement votre emménagement ou ne souscrivez pas de \\ncontrat pour votre nouvelle adresse, vous courez le risque de voir votre alimentation \\nélectrique et/ou de gaz coupée.\\nSi vous ne relevez pas correctement les compteurs, votre gestionnaire de réseau \\nprocèdera à une estimation de la consommation. Cette estimation ne correspondra \\nprobablement pas à votre consommation réelle. Vous risquez ainsi de vous voir \\nfacturer une partie de la consommation du locataire précédent ou, à l’inverse, de payer \\nune partie de la consommation du nouvel occupant de votre ancien logement.\\nVOUS AVEZ UNE INSTALLATION DE PRODUCTION DÉCENTRALISÉE (TELLE QUE \\nDES PANNEAUX PHOTOVOLTAÏQUES PAR EXEMPLE) ?\\nSi vous entrez ou si vous quittez une maison munie d’une installation de production \\ndécentralisée (telle que des panneaux photovoltaïques par exemple), vous devez \\nremplir le document de reprise des énergies spécifique à ce cas appelé «\\xa0Document de \\nreprise des énergies Électricité et/ou gaz naturel – Installation de production d’énergies \\nrenouvelables\\xa0». \\nCOMPAREZ ET TROUVEZ LE MEILLEUR CONTRAT D’ÉNERGIE\\nUn déménagement peut être un bon moment pour chercher un contrat d’électricité et \\nde gaz moins cher.

De kosten hiervoor - \\nalsook voor de heropening nadien - vallen wel ten laste van de aanvrager. \\n \\nDeze vermeldingen zijn conform de bepalingen van het waterverkoopreglement.
