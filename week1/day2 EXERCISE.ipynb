    "\n",
    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",

       "**Winner:** Galaadh\n",

       "Explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "Galaadh presents a more holistic digital transformation services approach, covering a broader range of topics and emphasizing long-term partnerships with senior expertise. Their website demonstrates the depth of their services, from technical advice and implementation to system integration and custom development. The testimonials from satisfied clients convey trust in their approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, Squareflow excels in presenting its Odoo expertise in an engaging and modern design. Its CTA is prominent, making it easy for potential leads to initiate contact or schedule a consultation. While the website lacks comprehensive services information and pricing details, its focus on digital transformation's importance and variety of connectors highlights potential integrations.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Recommendation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Galaadh would benefit from refining their website design to match modern standards while improving call-to-action presence and engagement metrics. By enhancing these aspects, Galaadh can increase visibility, build trust with new leads, and further differentiate themselves in the competitive digital transformation services market.\n",
       "\n",
       "Squareflow should consider expanding its service overview, providing a more comprehensive breakdown of their offerings beyond connectors. Nonetheless, their website effectively communicates their Odoo expertise, showcasing potential integrations with popular tools.\n",
       "\n",
       "By targeting strengths and improving weaknesses, both companies can reinforce their positions as trusted digital transformation partners or experts in the market."
